Hi! I am Aryaman Jeendgar, an incoming graduate student with the *School of Computation, Information and Technology* at the *Technische Universität München*, where I am going to be working with Professor Hartwig Anzt on building high quality HPC software for /randomized numerical linear algebra/ algorithms. I also aim to work on RandNLA theory and algorithms, work which I undertake closely with Professor Michael Mahoney's group at Berkeley.

# Hi! I am Aryaman Jeendgar, a final year undergrad from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus double majoring in Physics and Electronics and Communications engineering.

# Broadly, I am interested problems in Optimization Theory and their exciting intersection with modern Deep Learning, and love writing code to serve solutions to such problems!

I am currently a visiting scholar with [[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/][/Prof. Michael Mahoney's/]] group at UC Berkeley.

# Starting /August 2024/, I will be joining the [[https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu][/International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley/]] as a visiting scholar till July 2025, where I will work with [[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/][/Prof. Michael Mahoney's/]] group on problems in Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra!!! If you're in California during this time, HMU!!!

I successfully finished my graduate thesis (in physics) at the /International Computer Science Institute, UC Berkeley/ where I worked with [[https://rileyjmurray.wordpress.com][/Dr. Riley J. Murray/]] on problems related to the Operator Relative Entropy Cone and made more technical contributions to the CVXPY codebase in the process! You can find my thesis [[file:./Aryaman__Thesis.pdf][*here*]]

I successfully finished my undergraduate thesis at =CERN= where my visit was generously funded by /The Department of Physics, Princeton University/. I worked with [[https://www.lieret.net][/Dr. Kilian Lieret/]] on problems concerning a data-driven pipeline for charged particle trajectory prediction and parallely, worked with [[https://github.com/henryiii][/Dr. Henry Schreiner/]] on building =scikit-build-core=. You may find my thesis, [[file:./Aryaman_Jeendgar_thesis_Princeton.pdf][*here*]]

During this time I also simultaneously worked as a *Research Intern* @ TCS Research with [[https://mayank-baranwal.web.app][/Prof. Mayank Baranwal/]] and /Dr. Kushal Chakrabarti/ on problems related to second-order neural network training dynamics, and analyzing them from an ODE-perspective!

I spent the summer of /'23/ as a *Research Engineer Fellow* @ Princeton University (under /Princeton Research Computing/), where I worked with [[https://github.com/henryiii][/Dr. Henry Schreiner/]], contributing to the ongoing =scikit-HEP= effort. I also participated in the =GSoC-2023= program, where I (once again!) contributed to CVXPY!

I spent the summer of /'22/ writing open source code for [[https://www.cvxpy.org/][CVXPY]], under the [[https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/][GSoC-2022]] program and interning at Intel Labs in the /Cloud Systems/ Research group, where I worked with /Dr. Sameh Gobriel/ on online optimization approaches to scaling out Nearest Neigbour Search queries for graph databases.

In the past, I worked with [[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/snehanshus/profile][Professor Snehanshu Saha]] /(BITS Goa)/ and [[https://www.wadhwaniai.org/team/soma-dhavala/][Mr. Soma S. Dhavala]] /(Wadhwani AI)/ on problems related to quantile regression in the context of neural networks and systematic methods for accelerating training for such scenarios, a pre-print of our latest work can be found [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09333][*HERE*]]
